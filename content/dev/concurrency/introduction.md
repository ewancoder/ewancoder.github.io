## Introduction to concurrency

This is a short introduction into a world of concurrency: what it is, why we need it, and what programming problems we need to tackle when working with concurrency.

```csharp
public sealed class A
{
    public async Task<int> Run(string value)
    {
        return 10;
    }
}
```
