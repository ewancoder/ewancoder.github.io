## Dvorak experience

![Dvorak layout](dvorak-layout.jfif)

As a QWERTY touch typist, I've always wondered whether I should learn DVORAK keyboard layout. After almost three years of using it, I can highlight essential points for and against it. The short answer - you shouldn't learn it. The long one - you definitely should!

I should also say that I am an extensive VIM user, and I'm currently using Windows OS with a lot of keyboard shortcuts, I am also occasionally gaming. So DVORAK is assessed from these point of views:

* Typing speed
* Typing comfort
* Health
* VIM usage
* Coding
* Windows / software shortcuts
* Gaming

### Learning QWERTY

I started learning touchtyping at the end of 2010 year. It was a QWERTY layout. At first, my speed was slow, but I practiced it a lot throughout a year and was able to do 70-80 WPM towards the end of 2011.

> WPM means Words per Minute. One word is supposed to be exactly 5 characters, including all punctuation or space symbols, which means that the speed of 100 WPM would equal to 100 * 5 = 500 characters per minute.

I continued practicing touchtyping whenever I can and soon I was able to type 80-90 WPM, sometimes 95-98 WPM, while being completely relaxed. My speed averaged at 90 WPM, and I was content with it.

I always wanted to type faster than 100 WPM. It's a beautiful number, and saying that my typing speed is over 100 WPM is more impressive than 90. But I was mostly below 90 WPM. I also noticed one thing: the faster I typed, the more error-prone my typing was. Specifically, I started typing letters in the wrong order. So, instead of `would` I would type `wolud`, because some of my fingers were so eager to take their part in my typing session that they started pressing keys before the other fingers were supposed to press their keys.

My first thought was that my keyboard is to blame. So I acquired myself a mechanical keyboard with tactile switches that gave feedback on whether the key was pressed or not. This helped, but not by much. My speed increased, and sometimes I even managed to type faster than 100 WPM (very rarely), but then I started making the same mistakes again.

My second thought was that I reached some barier that I cannot overcome. I thought my brain was not capable of typing faster. Then I gave up. Until I read about [DVORAK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout).

### Learning DVORAK

Basically, QWERTY keyboard is a legacy from typewriter machines, where the keys pressed together would jam so specific keyboard layout was developed in order to keep the keys from jamming, meaning that ideally when typing words, keys from different parts of a typewriter machine should be pressed as far from each other as possible. It kept keys from jamming, but it created a whole bunch of other problems:

* overall typing speed was reduced
* you needed to stretch your fingers wide and often, resulting in a lot of addinional strain on wrists

The starnard bled into PC industry though, and all our modern keyboards that don't have the jamming issue still have the QWERTY layout.

Then Mr. Dvorak came into play. He suggested another keyboard layout, specifically designed for the comfort and speed. After analyzing a lot of English texts, a layout was created that utilized the home row of the keyboard as much as possible and made it so that you need to move your fingers from the home row as little as possible. So yes, DVORAK was created with an English language in mind. It can still be used with other languages, but it might not be as efficient as for English.

As a result, this layout allowed fingers to practically rest on the home row, strain on the wrists was supposed to be minimized and typing speed increased.

So, after almost nine years of using QWERTY layout, at the end of 2019, I finally decided to try learning DVORAK.

To say that it was painful is to say nothing. I was typing extremely slow, again. After 9 years of happy life, not ever thinking about how to type something or which keys are where. I couldn't continue using QWERTY either: I was determined to switch to DVORAK completely. I was sure my brain would not take it easy using two layouts at the same time.

First couple months were a pain my the arse. I practiced a lot, I learned all the keys, and then slowly, very slowly I started gaining speed. At the end of first months I was confidently typing 30-40 WPM. After that, it was a question of practice.

I signed up with one of the top teams on [Nitrotype](https://www.nitrotype.com) (one of the requirements of top teams is usually typing at least 50-60 races per day, so it was a good incensive for me). And I started typing.

After one month, I was typing 65-70 WPM, after another - 80-85 WPM. After that I fell into stagnation for half a year. I was excruciated. I couldn't even reach the same speed as before (on QWERTY). It looked like I'd plateaued again, only on QWERTY this plateau has been in the range of 95-100 WPM, where on DVORAK it happened at 80 WPM.

However, one thing felt definitely better. My fingers and my wrists. My fingers were much more relaxed now. They almost didn't move from the home row, they didn't stretch, they felt good and not tired at all. And furthermore, my wrists didn't hurt anymore. Previously, while typing on QWERTY, I had a carpal tunnel syndrome in my right wrist and from time to time it hurt. I am happy to say, that after switching to DVORAK this issue has disappeared from my life completely.

> To be fair, I have no idea whether the DVORAK helped with carpal tunnel syndrome or my new keyboard, UHK. I started using UHK because it allows you to place two separate halves of keyboard where it's comfortable for you, and your wrists are much more relaxed and not bent anymore.

So I was determined to continue using DVORAK, even if it meant slower typing speed and less confidence, because my wrists and fingers felt better. Apart from slower speed, I was also struggling for consistency. Because I was relearning from one layout to another, and not learning from scratch - sometimes my brain decided that this key was actually where it would be in QWERTY layout and try to press it there. The situation was aggravated by the fact that some of the keys in QWERTY and DVORAK layouts were at the same place (like `a` and `m`), which didn't help the brain to switch to new layout easily. With time, I got more confident, but I still felt that gnawing sensation that I'm not sure what I'm typing is what I'm typing. In QWERTY, I was comfortably typing and I knew without looking at the screen that I made a mistake when I made one. In DVORAK, when I would make a mistake - I would miss the fact that I made a mistake.

After almost 3 years of using DVORAK, my confidence got up, and with it my speed. Currently (in 2022) I'm able to type 90-95 WPM consistently, which is my previous QWERTY speed, but I'm also able to set over-100 WPM records much more often than on QWERTY. I think I'm finally starting to type faster than I was able to type on QWERTY, while feeling all the comfort DVORAK provides.

I'm still not 100% confident, and this is unpleasant, especially when I'm typing a password and get it wrong. I was more confident on QWERTY. I'm getting there though. With every passing day I feel that my confidence grows, and I think in a year or two I'll be able to be as precise as on QWERTY. I was using QWERTY for 9 years after all, and DVORAK only for 3. So I decided to stay with DVORAK for now and completely forget about QWERTY.

This isn't all, though. If typing English texts were all we need do with keyboard, I would definitely recommend everyone to make the switch without second thought. Alas we have a lot more concerns.
