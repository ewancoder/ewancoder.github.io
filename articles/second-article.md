## Freezing USB issues

Recently I noticed that from time to time my mouse starts to stutter and freeze, and sometimes random keys won't be pressed on the keyboard.

I have a pretty high-end PC, specifically assembled to be as fast and robust as possible. I hated this issue from the start. I just needed to dive into it and find and fix the source of this problem.
